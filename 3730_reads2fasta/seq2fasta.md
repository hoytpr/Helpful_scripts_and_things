## ABI 3730 raw seq files ##

In 2010, our 3730 sequencer needed a bunch of files on the sequences server to be converted into multi-fasta format.
I was asked to help, and decided it was time to test my new interest in coding. The result was a script in
Perl that actually worked, albeit under specific circumstances (see header of script). 

## What to call the script? ##

My original name was "Best9.pl" and then it was gloriously changed to "FinalPH-SeqFiles2MultiFasta.pl"
which was finally changed to "SeqFiles2MultiFasta.pl" after getting over myself and my accomplishment.
It was, however, an interesting journey. Maybe I'll write about it someday.
